# Ecommerce Backend

## Description
  
In order to keep track of different items within our product lines, I have developed a way to easily add, view, update, and delete items from our database. Now instead of manually having to go into our sql database to change information we can use insomnia and javascript to easily do it for us. I learned how to create models using sequelize, how to sync them to our sql database, and make relationships between different items within our database using sequelize for javascript.

## Installation
  
From the command line, clone this repo into your directory and install dependencies mysql2, sequelize, express, and dotenv. Create a .env file and add your database information to it in order to connect to your sql database. Install insomnia and use it to perform CRUD operations easily. Then create the database in sql using our schema.sql file, populate it with seeds by calling node seeds/index.js and then run the server with node server.js.

## Usage
  
Create different CRUD methods in your insomnia client and use them to test your website. Make sure any methods changing the database have their respective json attributes properly filled out.
